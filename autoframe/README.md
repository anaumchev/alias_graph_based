# alias_graph_based

Autoframe, is a tool that statically and automatically builds an Alias Graph of Eiffel code. 

The built graph can be used to infer the locations that a feature is allowed to modify. This is known as the Framing Problem. This inference is done by another tool implementation, alias_change.

Both tools are the implemetation of Alias and Change Calculi.
